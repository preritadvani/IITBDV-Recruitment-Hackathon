The YOLO model performs inference on the input image.<br>
Each detected object has a bounding box defined by four coordinates:
<br>
x1 → left boundary
<br>
y1 → top boundary
<br>
x2 → right boundary
<br>
y2 → bottom boundary
<br>
The height and width of the bounding box are calculated as:
<br>
Height:
<br>
height=y2−y1
<br>
Width:
<br>
width=x2−x1
<br>
These values represent the object's size in image pixels.
<br>
The system estimates object depth using a simplified pinhole camera model.

Formula used:
<br>
Depth=(Actual Height*focal length)/pixel height
<br>
Assumption:
<br>
1 mm=1 pixel
